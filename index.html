    <p>
      Welcome to the workbook that will change the way you think about every website you ever vist. 
      We spend so much of our time online, navigating from site to site. But where do all these websites come from? Who's making them? 
      Have you ever wondered whether <em>you</em> could make them too? Well, 
    </p>
    <p style="margin: 1ch auto 1ch auto; font-size: 2em"><strong style="color: #25442f">YOU CAN!</strong></p>
    <p>
      Whether you have lots of coding experience or none at all, you can learn to use digital tools to express yourself. 
      Think about how you learned your native language. Do you remember making any kind of conscious effort to study it? 
      Probably not... so how did you learn? 
    </p>
    <p>
      Most likely, you were surrounded by "materials" in your language — your family spoke it around you, 
      maybe you watched TV or listened to music in it. <strong style="color: #25442f">You learned naturally, simply by being immersed 
      in an environment rich with materials for exploration and interaction.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      This workbook will show you how, even without realizing, you are already immersed in the "language" of websites. All you have to do is look closely! Let's 
      get ready to venture into the Wild World of Websites.
    </p>
    <p>Before we set out, let's take stock of what we already know:</p>
    <h2>How would you describe websites to someone who's never heard of them?</h2>

        To get a good look at a website, we need to go beyond what we see with
        just our eyes. We need to take a closer look at what lies underneath;
        the code.
        <br />
        <br />
        Our main tool is going to be the
        <span class="definable" id="webInspector">Web Inspector</span>.
        <br />
        <br />
        Right-click <strong>☛ RIGHT HERE ☚</strong> and select "Inspect".

          <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row;">
            <p>
              To keep the page you're inspecting at full-width, you can also pull the Web Inspector into its 
              own window. Look for the three dots menu on the top right, and select the Dock Side option that 
              looks like two windows.

        <h1>Exploring Structure: HTML</h1>
        <p>
          HTML stands for <strong>Hypertext Markup Language</strong>. Historically, markup languages were used 
          to annotate text content (for example, a manuscript) to let the typesetter know how different parts of 
          the text should look once it's printed. For example, the markup language can note what 
          text should be bolded, italicized, be in a different font, be a section header, and so on.
          <img src="https://i.ibb.co/NWsTJsX/manuscript.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
          Back in the Web Inspector, find the elements that look something like:
            <ul style="margin-bottom: 0">
              <li><span class="purple">&lt;h1></span></li>
              <li><span class="purple">&lt;p></span></li>
              <li><span class="purple">&lt;strong></span></li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          These are called <strong>tags</strong>!
          Just like a manuscript markup has symbols that communicate to the typesetter the purpose of a 
          piece of content and how it should look once printed, <strong>HTML tags are symbols that tell your web browser the purpose of a 
          piece of content.</strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          When you hover over HTML tags, the corresponding section in this workbook should become highlighted.
          <img src="https://i.ibb.co/h7vGw1J/Screen-Shot-2021-11-13-at-5-05-24-PM.png" />
          HTML tags are often nested inside of each other. You can expand a tag by clicking the arrow to its left.
          <br />
          <br />
        </p>
        <h2 style="margin-top: 0; padding-top: 0;">How would you describe the relationship between an HTML tag and the content inside it in your own words?</h2>
        <div class="paper">
          <div class="paper-content">
            <textarea onchange="addTextareaContent(this)"></textarea>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          There are way too many types of HTML tags to cover here, but you can find out about all of them within 
          <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element" target="_blank">Mozilla's Developer Documentation</a>. 
          Mozilla's Web Docs are a great reference source not just for HTML, but for many other web technology you may be curious about, like CSS and JavaScript.

        <p>
          Let's take a look at a few common HTML tags. You can see the HTML code for each tag in the first column. You can also
          find the relevant bits of code in the Web Inspector.

          <!-- activity where changing emphasis changes sentence meanig OR poem line breaks -->
          <p>Let's spend some time tinkering with tags through the Web Inspector! Try these to start:</p>
          <h6>i'm so small... i wish i was big and important</h6>
          <strong>I WISH I WAS JUST A NORMAL PARAGRAPH</strong>
          <br />
          <p>My image is broken! Can you fix it?</p>
          <img src="my image URL is broken... can you replace it with one that works?" />
          <br />
          <br />
          <p>
            HTML tags can have attributes. For example, <span class="purple">src</span> is an attribute of the <span class="purple">&lt;img></span> tag.
            Attributes can be added or deleted through the WebInspector. Try removing the disabled attribute from the button below.
          </p>
          <button disabled>I want to be clickable!</button>
          <p>It's also possible to use the Web Inspector to fully delete tags.</p>

              First you have to upload your screenshoot to a hosting service. <a href="https://imgbb.com/" target="_blank">ImgBB</a> is a free option.
              Then, you need to get the image URL. You can right click the image and look for something like "Copy Image Address". You can also drag 
              the image to your browser's URL bar and copy what shows up there.
              <br />
              <br />
              Paste your url into the <span class="purple">src</span> attribute of the <span class="purple">&lt;img /></span> tag.

          <h1>Exploring Styling: CSS</h1>
          <p>
            Think about the websites you visit often. How similar do they look? How can the same HTML tags <em>look</em> so diferent on different sites?
            <h2 style="margin: 0">How can this be an <span class="purple">&lt;h2&gt;</span></h2>
            <h2 style="font-family:'Courier New'; color:cadetblue; font-size: 0.7em;">And this is also an <span class="purple">&lt;h2&gt;</span></h2>
            But they look totally different? Let's <span style="margin: 2ch auto 0 auto">ﾟ･✧･ﾟINSPECTﾟ･✧･ﾟ</span>
            <img src="https://i.ibb.co/BVFCLR1/Screen-Shot-2021-11-14-at-11-47-33-AM.png" />
          </p>
          <p>
            The key is in the "style" attribute on the <span class="purple">&lt;h2&gt;</span> tag. In the style attribute, you can write CSS.
            <strong>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and it's the language that we can use to better define how elements on a webpage should look.</strong>
            <br />
            <br />
            <div style="display: flex;">
              <p>It's easier to see an element's styling if you look at the <span class="definable" id="StylesTab">Styles tab</span> near the bottom.</p>
              <img style="width: 50%; margin-left: 2ch" src="https://i.ibb.co/WPx9cjr/Screen-Shot-2021-11-14-at-11-47-51-AM.png" />

          <!-- something about checking and unchecking boxes -->
          <!-- extended resources especially about how the cascade works -->
          <!-- include section on how to save your work -->
          <!-- have a place for people to add name and date and etc -->
          <p>You can do a lot of styling right in the Styles tab for an element. You can edit one of its' property, delete one, or add a whole new property.</p>

            <br />
            <p style="background-color: darkseagreen;">You can also add or change a background color to elements. What's your favorite color?</p>
            <br />
            <p style="background-color: sandybrown; border-style: dashed; border-color: seagreen; border-width: 10px;">You can create a lot of visual interest with just a border and a background. Refer to the Mozilla documentation to learn about all the possibilities for <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border" target="_blank">borders</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-color" target="_blank">backgrounds</a> and get creative here!</p>

Cool right?? Check out my styles in the inspector! What looks fun to change?</p>

            <p style="cursor: grab">You can style so many things with CSS, including the cursor. Hover over me to see! Can you change this hover cursor to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/cursor" target="_blank">a different one?</a></p>
            <p>CSS is also used for more structural properties like whether an element is displayed or not. Try using the Styles tab to toggle the visibility of the leaves, maybe you'll find something cool!</p>
            <div class="leafBox">
              <img src="./images/snail.png" style="visibility: visible; right: 60px; top: 60px; width: 10%;" />

              <img src="./images/leaf.png" style="visibility: visible; left: 50%; margin-left: -87px"/>
              <img src="./images/leaf.png" style="visibility: visible; right: 0;"/>

            Even people who have been coding for the web for years don't know all the possible CSS properties. When in doubt, you can always refer to this 
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Properties_Reference" target="_blank">list of most common CSS properties</a>, or 
            the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference" target="_blank">extended reference</a>. When you come across an unfamiliar
            property in the wild, you can search for it on MDN to learn more.

              The web really is a wild, continously expansive place. But it doesn't mean you need years of training or a degree in Computer Science to interact with it in a personal way.
              Through this workbook, you learned how to use the Web Inspector to take a closer look at some of the materials that make up the web: HTML & CSS. More than just looking, you 
              reached into the inner workings and made this page your own!
              <br />
              <br />
              You can download this page with all your wonderful additions by clicking <a onclick="this.href='data:text/html;charset=UTF-8,'+encodeURIComponent(document.documentElement.outerHTML)" href="#" download="index.html">here!</a>
              If you then want to create a new site with <strong>YOUR</strong> version of this workbook, you can use <a href="https://app.netlify.com/drop" target="_blank">Netlify</a> to deploy it. All you need to do is 
              put your file inside a folder and drag that onto the page at the link above.
